    <h1> <u>ABOUT ME </u></h1>
    <p>I am a junior honors computer science student studying at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.
        I began my coding journey in my senior year of high school when I took AP Computer Science and 
        it was through this that I developed a strong passion for the subject. This eventually led me
        to the decision to continue my studies of CS in college. I'm currently interested in front-end web development,
        but I also enjoy learning back-end technologies as I eventually want to become a full stack developer
        in the future.

    <h1><u>INTERESTS</u></h1>
    <p>
        Outside of learning, I enjoy playing sports, video games, going to the gym, and serving the community.  
        In my freshman year of college I played for my school's A team for table tennis and participated
        in numerous tournaments throughout the semester.  Although I don't play for them now, I still like
        to play table tennis recreationally and teach newer players. I have also served as the community service
        and philanthropy chairs of my fraternity where I planned events and fundraisers to give back to the 
        community.
